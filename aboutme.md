title: About Ethan Keller
---

I use software to solve large environmental problems. I have both a BS in Environmental Engineering and an M. Eng in Computer Science from Cornell University. I come from Massachusetts and I like to turn bowls, play frisbee, construct buildings and tinker in my spare time.
