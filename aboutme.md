title: About Ethan Keller

I'm interested in the balance between detailed, perfection-oriented engineering, and world-wide problem solving. I think in many ways they involve similar methodologies and yet our siloed education system scatters these skills into fragmented techniques. For example, I believe that constructing inexpensive, easy to maintain water treatment systems (requiring detail-oriented engineering) can empower the communities they serve, and enable worker action and stronger labor laws (large, societal shifts.) I studied Environmental Engineering and Computer Science and I am currently living in Honduras working for [AguaClara](http://aguaclara.cee.cornell.edu/) to build gravity-powered drinking water treatment plants.
