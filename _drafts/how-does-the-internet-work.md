# The Internet as the Postal Service
I've been learning how the internet works, and it seems like there are many similarities between how packets (internet speak for messages) and mail are sent and delivered. Admittedly, as with all metaphores, some similarities are stronger than others. I found quite a few articles specifically on these metaphors, and I wanted to share a summary of my findings, including which analogies seemed most helpful.
