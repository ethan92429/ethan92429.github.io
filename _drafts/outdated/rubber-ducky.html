title: "Rubber Ducky Debugging"

<script src="/js/rubberducky.js"></script>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">Rubber duck debugging</a> is a helpful trick for when you are stuck trying to find a bug. The idea is to tell a rubber duck (or any inanimate object for that matter) what your problem code is doing line by line. Unfortunately, I don't carry around a rubber ducky with me, but I did want the option to talk to a ducky, so I made Ducky. You can speak to him about anything... from life's grand challenges to complex C bugs. Also, if you want to feel heard, you can ask ducky to actively listen to you!</p>
<p> Ducky is slowly evolving into my own, personalized productivity tool. Ducky can: plan breaks throughout your work period, track your tasks and record how much time you've been working on a specific project and recommend certain activities to accomplish during breaks.</p>
