        <title>Observations from the backseat of a white Mitsubishi 2002 half-ton pickup on drives between Las Vegas and Tegucigalpa, Honduras</title>
        <description>
          
          Two vendors smile in the heat, and offer green mangoes with hot sauce. Last night we saw a performer gulp gasoline and blow fire. The word is coming over a static radio criticizing the president for an illegal third term. Plants lining the street shake with growth The Municipal buildings...

        <description>
          
          We have just finished the theory component of operator training in Las Vegas, Honduras. Five weeks of classes Tuesday through Friday. We have covered plant components, water systems, basic math and unit conversions. We’ve taken two field trips. And we’ve been building the flocculator baffles, plate settlers in the sedimentation...

          We just finished the first week of operator training in Las Vegas and we are driving back to Tegucigalpa, five of us in the white half-ton mitsubishi. In front of me sits German (pronounced Hair-mon), wearing a yellow shirt and a 1/2” haircut. He sports a fantastically round belly. He...

          I am building a data visualization app for water treatment plant operators in Honduras. I want to build it based on the html/css/js code that already exists so I decided to use either appcelerator or phonegap. I have no connections to either one, so here is an unbiased analysis explaining...

        <title>First Day in Haiti</title>
        <description>
          
          The crew woke up at 5AM to fly out of Fort Lauderdale. We stayed in a Rodeway Inn, the cheapest hotel available in Miami, but with surprisingly comfortable mattresses. The hotel was tacky in everything from the gift store to the landscaping. We were groggy when we stumbled into the...
